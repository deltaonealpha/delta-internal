                    <p style="color: rgb(146,146,146);padding: 9px;margin: 0px;">Yo bois, added random text here to see how it looks in light mode, in all its glory. Source: t.me/edins_copypastas</p>
                    <p style="color: rgb(146,146,146);padding: 9px;margin: 0px;">I'm sorry, but did Trump already lose? Oh, that's right. The election isn't even over yet. In fact, we still need to take this case to the Supreme Court. Does not having the lead before going to the Supreme Court count as a loss? Is
                        that what you're saying? Because if you're saying that I can assure you that you're wrong.&nbsp;<br></p>
                    <p style="color: rgb(146,146,146);padding: 9px;margin: 0px;">Why would you make this topic when the election is still going? Votes are still being verified right now and he has been the best President in America for how many years now?&nbsp;<br></p>
                    <p style="color: rgb(146,146,146);padding: 9px;margin: 0px;">He's up against one of the worst candidates ever who just happen to have a lead because they're counting fraudulent votes. But you know what? Biden still fucking sucks. Trump is one of the best fucking Presidents in history, he had
                        record low unemployment last year and would of had it this year if Coronavirus didn't get made up. Maybe you should shut the fuck up before you make retarded topics like this. You know why? Because you're going to be embarrassed
                        when Trump wins and someone bumps this topic.&nbsp;<br></p>
                    <p style="color: rgb(146,146,146);padding: 9px;margin: 0px;">Oh look at that, Clarence Thomas just had a flashback of being called a nigger by Joe Biden, just like Hilary did. Are you a fucking drunk? Are you retarded? Are you autistic? You are a fucking idiot and you should never make a topic
                        on this board again and I'm fucking serious. I almost have a feeling you're the only guy making all these anti-Trump topics because you're a faggot hater who doesn't like the President because he is good.&nbsp;<br></p>

It's so easy to spot out your threads now, you're a retard. Always doing stupid shit like this. Why
                            don't you try to be a good poster? Just for once? For once in your fucking life try not to make a topic like this. That's just you, you're always right at getting it wrong. Fuck you. You are nothing.<br></p>

The birds cheer me up. The crickets crack so softly and sweet that time o’ day, up in Wisconsin. Do not add me. Comment below why. I
                                realized my son was gay, so many feelings going on in his head. My wife loves to bake my apple pie on Thursdays, pie day. I used to play CS:S with my crew, Johnny passed. Love you Johnny.<br><br>“A time a day, keep your
                                friends close.” - Bob Dylan i loved that man like my brother. God rest my brother’s soul. Love ya. I used to listen to Cash a lot, moved on from em. I live with Jane. My son going to college, Ive got high hopes in him and
                                his faith. That little rascal was always so cute when i changed his diapers. Sometimes you gotta ignore the crying.for babies if you want them to grow stronger. I answered all his cries…<br></p>

My dad taught me that in the 5th grade when i was in school. Didnt like school, but my 8th grade science teacher was
                                a beautiful woman! We went out behind the school a few times and i regret it, She raised my kid. I wanted to name him Bill.<br><br>I had drill sergeant wasnt a bad man, he’d have a smoke with us puttin on Cash. Two tours
                                and he was there when i got home. I was so happy to see him, i cried. WE got so drunk I shit myself and told him about bill, Mrs.Melinda better have named him that, that was my graduation wish. She doesnt text me anymore.
                                Drill Sergeant trained me to survive. I built up my path to success, now my son tearing it away. God help us.<br>&nbsp;<br><br>Let me try to reasonate with you for a moment please. Thank you.<br><br>I don't want to ask
                                what you mean by having your alias exposed or about your use of aliases, and I can only imagine you didn't want to privately contact us for having that umpteenth stupid channel that nobody in the world needs in a list of
                                discordian channel right after a fucking non exquisite resistance of esoteric which with its stupid pic would rather be exoteric of a virgin da fuck. I also don't want to know whether you're inside our fabulous group as

                                She hasn't said a word to me in 10 hours and I'm worried she's gonna take away my ThinkPad. I might not ever get to see Xenia again.<br>&nbsp;<br>I just saw 1.02mm of natsuki’s shoulder. I immediately fell to my knees,
                                as the rush of dopamine signaling my impending earth-shattering orgasm started making me moan loud enough to deafen everyone in the immediate vicinity. What followed was a torrential downpour of every single sperm cell
                                I ever have or ever will produce, shot out so hard that my dick was ripped apart by my übernut accelerating to 5% the speed of light by the time it left my urethra. It vaporized natsuki as it punched right through her,
                                barely slowed, before cutting through a structural support beam in the school as if it were a nuclear-powered angle grinder. The sheer weight of this historical nut, combined with the total destruction of everything in
                                its path, caused the school to collapse, and every female in the history of anime to fall pregnant with my children. When the final death toll was tallied, there were 146 deaths, 458 injuries, and over 4 million pregnancies.
                                As I lay dying under the rubble of the high school, I rest easy, knowing every one of my sons will repeat my glorious actions. Goodbye.<br></p>
